Problem & Motivation
• Problem/Task: How to maximize
the speed of auto driving agent
when driving in a 2D racetrack to
reach the destination from start.
• Experience: Sequence of
observations from visual (RGB
pixels), speed, wheel position,
gyroscope, along with feedback
from interactions involving steering,
acceleration, and breaking.
• Performance: Time to finish track
• Motivation: We love car race

Methods
• We will be building a model that
uses CNNs to understand visual
data from a car racing game. The
CNN looks at the images to find
important details, then passes this
information through layers to learn
how to control the car.
• The model will predict three
actions: steering, gas, and brake,
with outputs limited to the right
ranges for each action. We'll train it
using the PPO algorithm, which
helps the model learn by trying to
get better at racing over time.
• We'll measure how well the model
works by looking at the total score,
how long it lasts in the race, and
how good its driving looks.

Evaluation Plan
• Dataset: multiple random
racetracks generated by the Box2D
(https://gymnasium.farama.org/envi
ronments/box2d/car_racing/)
• Agent will be tested on unseen
tracks for evaluation.
• The evaluation metrics will contain
“track finish time”, “completion
rate”, and “off-track and collision”.
• The training process involves
setting the driving agent to drive
through the maps and adjust
weights and biases by the best
performed drive, using the
accumulated sequence of optimal
decision obtained by far.
